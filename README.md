# Burger-Website
The Burger Website project is a creative and responsive landing page designed using HTML and CSS. The goal of the project is to showcase a modern and attractive web interface for a burger hut or fast-food restaurant. The structure of the website includes essential sections such as a header with navigation links, a visually appealing hero section highlighting signature burgers, a menu section displaying popular items with descriptions and prices, and a contact section for customer inquiries. The design follows a dark theme with vibrant highlights, giving it a trendy and appetizing look.
